Hello Michael

I've manually gone through you xml file (if you are interested and can run
perl I have a script called xmlpretty.pl while makes it a lot more readable.

And I have the following questions/comments/notes:

        * Well formed XML documents should begin with '<?xml version='1.0'?>
        * char -> rmsscharacter: Lets be namespace friendly to other xml
documents - also I keep thinking of a signed or unsigned type guarenteed to
be able to hold one character...
        * charname -> name: Its the characters file - so it should just be 
name also remove the phrase 'char' again.  
        * 'Abilities': Can we change it to <stats>.  Abilities is not an
RM term (it is a Storyteller term for the RM equiv of skills though).
        * class -> profession: Class is the AD&D term - we should use RM
vernicular hence profession.
        * What are all the '+'s for?  is that an artifact of your xml engine?
        * I've made realmstat a flag on a stat, also have done the same
for prime requisites.  
        * Can we use the full name for RRs?  As they say in the XML goals:
'Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance'. 
        * I save the BD and PP progression with the skills themselves.
Hence no need to duplication.  (If someone needs to tweak their character
manually)
        * Progressions : Your xml library seems to encode '/' as %2F for
reason.  This is how you encode html chracters, so its rather confused - '/'
in any position is valid in XML.  Secondly %2F should not be encoded or
unencoded - it should be passed through as is.  
        * Progression Replacement: May I suggest the use of either '*' or
the ' ' - "Middle Dot" (also called bullet) character for iso 8859-1 (latin)
(and hence also unicode).  This has the value of 183 (0267/0xB7).  I use it
in my ps printouts and it appears quite nice.
        * Progressions (Again): Can we use Standard/Combined/Limited for
progressions that fall into those categories.  I use 'Racial(0*6*5*4*3)' for
BD and PP.
        * Appearance is a stat as far as I'm concerned, along with sanity
and willpower.  Obviously I need to make sure that I handle them
appropriatly.  
        * Defensive  : what is 'da', 'dt' & 'ds'?  
        * I use whitespace and get my parser to ignore it between elements -
can  you easily do the same?  It makes it a _lot_ more readable.
(essentially I set 'xml:space=default' on rmsscharacter
        * (Bug?) 38742 XP is 3rd level - not 4th as Ragnor is...
        
        Now as for your skills - I'm afraid I don't understand what you have
done at all!
        My suggestion would be something like:
<skills>
        <category>
                <catname>Awareness * Senses</name>
                <progression>Limited</progression>
                <catranks>2</catranks>
                <!-- other stuff for category goes here -->
                <skill>
                        <skillname>Alertness</name>
                        <skillranks>2</ranks>
                        <!-- ... -->
                </skill>
                <skill>
                        <skillname>Sensse Ambush>
                        <!-- ... -->
                </skill>
        </category>
        ...
</skills>
