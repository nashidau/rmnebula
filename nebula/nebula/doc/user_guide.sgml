  <title>What is Nebula ?</title>
  <para>
   &Nebula; is a Rolemaster character editor. It can create and maintain
   Rolemaster characters, thus allowing to manage your PCs and
   NPCs electronically. It is an open source application. But the
   data are copyrighted by Iron Crown Enterprise (I.C.E). You have
   to own the Rolemaster books to legally use the data for
   &Nebula;.

   The current stable release is the  
   <ulink url="http://www.nash.nu/Rolemaster/Nebula/downloads/nebula-0.2.0.tar.gz">
   0.2.0</ulink>. 
   You have to get the
   <ulink url="http://www.nash.nu/Rolemaster/Nebula/downloads/nebula-data.tar.gz">
   data files</ulink>
   too (you must have the Rolemaster books).
  </para>

  <para>
   You can grab a release there, or checkout the
   <application>CVS</application> version following
   the instructions available on

 <section>
  <title>Compiling Nebula</title>
  <para>
   &Nebula; has only been tested on a x86 Linux box so far. It requires
   an <application>ANSI C</application> compiler
   (<application>gcc</application> works fine),
   the <application>GTK+2</application> library
   (<ulink url="http://www.gtk.org/">http://www.gtk.org/</ulink>)
   and the <application>Gnome 2</application> library
   (<ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</ulink>)
   installed and working.
   If you want to access the printing functions, you'll also need a
   XSLT processor, as <application>Xalan</application> or
   <application>Sablotron</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Once you got either the CVS version or a release file, go to
   the <filename>nebula/</filename> directory and type
   <command>make</command> at the prompt. There
   is no automatic configuration of the <application>Makefile</application>
   at the moment. You might have to correct the
   <application>Makefile</application> considering your own
   installation if the compilation doesn't work properly. As the
   <application>Makefile</application> uses the <command>pkg-config</command>
   system, libraries should be correctly found.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you want to install &Nebula; in a directory, edit the
   <application>Makefile</application> in the <filename>nebula/</filename>
   directory and change the PREFIX value according to your wishes
   before calling <application>Makefile</application>.
  </para>

 <section>
  <title>Running Nebula</title>
  <para>
   Run &Nebula; by launching the <command>nebula</command> application
   found in the <filename>nebula/src</filename> directory or directly
   if you've installed <command>nebula</command> in a directory
   present in your path.
  </para>

  <para>
   Each time you run &Nebula;, you are asked to agree to a legal text
   due to the copyrighted material the application is using. Be
   sure you can legally use this material before clicking the

 <section>
  <title>Creating a new character</title>
  <para>
   This section explains how to create a Rolemaster character from scratch
   using &Nebula;.
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
    First, select the
    <menuchoice>
     <shortcut>
      <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>N</keysym></keycombo>
     </shortcut>
     <guimenu>File</guimenu>

    </menuchoice>
    menu item ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    The first thing you have to do is to choose the <emphasis>Genre</emphasis>.
    The <emphasis>Genre</emphasis> is a configuration file which discribes the
    rules you want to use : what skills are available, what are the
    specific realms,...
    A <emphasis>Genre</emphasis> can be <emphasis>Shadow World</emphasis>
    for example ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    Then you enter the character name. You can see on the main window
    that once you've entered the name, it appears on the Character
    panel ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    Choose a race. The possibilities are determined by the setting
    you chose. If you chose the <emphasis>Shadow World genre</emphasis>,
    then you'll be offered the <emphasis>Shadow World</emphasis>
    races and cultures ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    Choose a profession ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    If there are choices to do concerning the special skills (everyman,
    occupational or restricted), you'll be presented windows asking
    for your choices ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    If the realm for the profession is not fixed, you will be asked
    for it. If the subrealm for the professional realm is defined
    in the chosen <emphasis>genre</emphasis>, you will be asked to choose one ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    Choose your weapon skill costs. You can swap skills by drag and
    droping their names ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    If the character is a spell caster, you will be able to select
    the base lists by clicking in the boxes you choose in the
    '<guilabel>Base?</guilabel>'
    column. Once you've selected the required number of lists, you'll
    be able to validate the window ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    Next, a window with spell list names will ask which spell lists
    you will want to be shown or not for your character. By default,
    the base lists you've chosen will not be checked for deletion.
    If the character has no base list, the lists of the realm are
    unchecked. Validate the window when you're satisfied with your
    choices. Be careful, in this version, you won't be able to add
    spell lists you've deleted in this phase, unless you edit your
    character file manually ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    Distribute points in your temporary stats. Depending on the option
    you choose in the 
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
     <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    menu you have either
    660 or 600+10d10 points. &Nebula; sets
    the prime-requisite stats for the profession to 90 and distributes
    the remaining points among other stats equally. You can then
    change the number according to your wishes. Prime-requisists
    cannot be set under 90, other stats cannot be set under 20.
    The maximum for all stats in this version is 100 ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    Once you've distributed all the remaining points, click the
    <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> button ;
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
    You are now on the <guilabel>Purchase List</guilabel> where you
    will be able to spend
    your hobby ranks. To allocate points to a skill or a category,
    select it and click on the <guilabel>New</guilabel> column on the
    row you've selected.
    Enter the points you want to set for the skill or category and
    press <guibutton>Enter</guibutton> ;

    Up as many time as you want. Each time the <guilabel>Buy Skills</guilabel>
    window will be opened, you'll be offered the full development points
    the character has for one level. So be sure to spend all your
    development points when making the character gain a level, and

    stats if you chose this option (disabled in this version).
    Press <guilabel>Ok</guilabel>
    if you want to keep the new stats or close the window if you
    don't want to keep them.

   <para>
    You use this function on some special cases as written in the
    Rolemaster rules.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can't make a stat gain on a single stat in this version (it
    is sometimes asked by Training Packages). You'll have to edit
    the saved file to change the value if you want it.

   </section>

   <section>
   <title>Buy Skills</title>
   <para>
    Opens a window where you can buy skills. To buy levels, choose
    a skill or a category by clicking on the line you want and then
    cliking in the New column of this line. Enter the number of
    level you want to buy and press enter. If this level is too
    high for the costs of the profession, it will be canceled. Otherwise,
    the cost will be calculated in the <guilabel>Spent</guilabel> column
    and added to the total cost on the bottom of the window.
   </para>
   <para>
    The skills and categories are organised as a tree. You can open
    the skills of a category by clicking on the horizontal arrow
    on the left of the category. You close the display of the skills
    of a category by clicking on the arrow pointing down on the
    left of the category.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you're done with buying skills, click <guibutton>Ok</guibutton>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Be careful, in this version of &Nebula;, you can open this window
    as many times as you want for a level, and the developement
    spent are renewed each time. You don't want that if you want
    to level up a character normally.
   </para>
   <para>
    You will be able to buy Training Packages from here by clicking
    the <guibutton>Buy TP</guibutton> button, not active in this version.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can save or load your purshased skills in or from a file.
    Thus you can prepare templates for the skills you're buying
    in a level.
   </para>
   </section>

   <section>
   <title>Refresh</title>
   <para>
    This is a safety function. It asks &Nebula; to recomputes all the
    bonuses for stats, categories and skills. When loading a file,
    this function is automatically called even if calculations are
    already in the saved file, ensuring there has been no corruption
    of this file.
   </para>
   <para>
    You have to click the refresh button after editing the stats with the
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
     <guimenuitem>Stats</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    in this version.
    <note>
     <title>Note</title>
     <para>
     This automatic call is why you can edit the stats manually
     by editing the file. There is no need to fix the bonuses after
     such an edition, they will be recomputed.

   <para>
    In this version, there are no check on these values. There is
    also no way to add categories others than those added while
    creating a new character. You can still add categories by editing
    the file directly, but be certain to know what you are doing.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Stats</title>
    <para>
     This panel displays all the stats of the character. This panel
     can handle as many stat you want. But only the first ten stats
     will be handled in stat gain. Any file with less than ten stats
     will be considered as invalid.
   </para>
   <para>
    The first two columns are check boxes. The first column (P) shows
    the prime-requisite stats. A checked 'P' box tells that the
    statistic on this line is a prime-requisite. The second column
    (R) shows the realm stats. A checked 'R' box tells that the
    statistic on this line is a statistic for the realm of the character.
   </para>
   <para>
    The next two columns tell the complete name of the stats and
    there abbreviations.
   </para>
   <para>
    Next are the temporary stat values, the potential stat values
    and the different bonuses : basic, racial and special. At now,
    you can't edit the special bonus directly, you have to edit
    the saved file.
   </para>
   <para>
    The last column shows the sum of the different bonuses.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Skills</title>
   <para>
    This panels shows the different categories and skills, organized
    as a tree : you can expend and collapse categories by clicking
    of the arrows on the left.
   </para>
   <para>
    After the name of the category or skill is displayed the different
    stats used in the stat bonus. The class column tells if a given
    skill is restricted, occupational or everyman. If nothing is
    displayed in this column, the skill is normal. The prog column
    shows the progression of the skill (see your Rolemaster book
    to check the meaning of the different values). Then comes the
    cost and the different bonus, with the sum at the end.
   </para>
   <para>
    At the last column, on the right, a check box can promote a skill/category
    to a primary skill/category.
    If the box is checked, the skill/category will be a canditate, in character
    sheets, to appear at some special place. For example, you can check the
    skills the character often uses.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you select a skill and right click, a pop-up menu appears.
    In this menu, you can show, edit or delete the skill or category you've
    selected. You can also add a new skill in the same category
    of the skill which is selected.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you double click on a skill or a category, a window appears
    and allows the edit the characteristics of it (name, stats of the bonus,
    everyman, occupational or restricted class, type of progression, cost,
    profession bonus, special bonus and description). You can also change
    the number of ranks the character has.
