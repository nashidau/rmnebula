What is Nebula?

        Nebula is a Open Source character generator for Rolemaster Standard
        System (RMSS) and Rolemaster Fantasy Roleplay (RMFRP).  It allows
        you to create, modify and maintain rolemaster characters.  Data is
        stored in a publically available XML format.  For more information
        on the format see http://nash.nu/Rolemaster/XML/

Building Nebula.

        To build nebula enter the source directory, and try typing make.
        Ideally it should build out of the box.  This version of nebula does
        not contain autoconf scripts or anything similar, so you will need
        to play with the Makefile.  Hopefully all you will need to change is
        the 

Requirements.

        Nebula is a Gnome 2 application, to run the program you will need
        Gnome 2 libraries, and their dependancies.
        
        Otherwise you will need the data files, available seperatly, for
        this application.  Note the data files are not covered by the GPL.
