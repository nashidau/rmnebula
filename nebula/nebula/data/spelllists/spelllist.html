<p class="spell">1. 
      <span class="spellname">Relive Experience</span>
      &mdash;
      
                   The caster causes the target to relive an experience
                   chosen by the caster at the of casting.  If the target is
                   in a relaxed state of mind, the target will be in a
                   reverie and obvlivious to his surroundigs unless
                   disturbed (loud noise, physical prod, etc).  If the
                   target is active, the target will remain active but be
                   distracted by momentary flashbacks and the attempts of
                   his mind to relate the exxperience to the current
                   situation (-20 to all actions).  This spell will also
                   provide the target with a +25 bonus to recalling specific
                   details of the remembered experience.  This bonus is not
                   cumulative with Force Recall or Recall spells.
                </p>
<p class="spell">2. 
      <span class="spellname">Memory Cue</span>
      &mdash;
      The caster can select a topic and obtain one
                cue per level of the caster from the target.  Each cue will
                relate to an experience of the target with respect to the
                topic.  These cues are used as the triggers for the Relive
                or and Share Experience Spells
