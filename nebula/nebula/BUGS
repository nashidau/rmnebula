This file lists known bugs.  Also you should list any fixed bugs.
This will also eventually form the basis for a set of regression tests.

Outstanding:
 * Closing the preferences dialog should save all values.
        [Currently you need to hit enter in the current field to get
         it to save]
 * Character sheets should have Race at the top.
 * Alena exits on a malformed XML file - make it return an error instead
 * Paths to data files don't seem to work
 * Files for printing characters not part of Nebula
 
Fixed:
 * Selecting languages properly on creation (20021130)
 	[Supported, just no race file uses it ;-)]
 * Freeze if you select Rogue or Thief when creating (??)
 * Limited progression for 0 ranks is -30 (20020928)
 * Progressions with spaces screw up badly (20020928)
 * The description in the right click on skill and the description in
        the double click on skill doesn't seem to correspond (20021005).
        [Fixed; previously right click popups were skill specific, and 
         totally ignored the <description> tag]
 * Clicking 'cancel' on buy skills during level up exits nebula
        [Can't reproduce]
