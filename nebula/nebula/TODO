A general to do list for nebula.
Ideally each of these should be done before the next release.
An allocated job has a <person> after it.

 * Add talents/flaws
 * Allow nebula to have multiple characters loaded (a window per
         character)
 * Define full profession, genre and TP formats.
 * Make pretty-print formats for above
 * Stardust: Write <nash>
 * Alchemist: Write <Sylvain>
 * WorldBuilder: Write (genre file editor)
 * Coach (training package editor): Write
 * Guild (profession editor): Write
 * Redo creation to make more use of '<choice>' tags in the input
         and genre files
 * Equipment and inventory <Sylvain>
 * TP support (the trick is being able to add and remove them)
 * Spell list hooks
 * Calculations like DB (I think we need a calculation language
         so it can be generalised)
 * i18n, gettext. Maybe hard to do, because it means changing 
   *every* string in the program. (Partially done)
 * Character images (say base 64 encoded, or a link)
 * Race based profession limitations.
 * Export/transform on inputs (nebula the filter basically):
        nebula --export elvis.html elvis.xml
 * Need a gconf schema file for configuration items
 * Export menu items
 * Save functions should return a value - 0 or -1 for success or failure.
        Currently they just ignore errors
 * Add The Psychomancer from Dec 2002 Guild companion issue to profession
        files.  Should add other professions as well.
 * Remove alena, and use libxml instead
 * Move world builders semi-generalised creation into libneb

 * Go through tree and skill code to see if an unitilazed field may cause a
        crash.  Possibly an uninitialized variable or similar.
 * Tree.c should have some sort of warning when creating new categories
        at load time if a flag is set.  So a new category in a race file
        should throw a warning, while a new category ina  genre file is
        fine.

Done:
 * "nebula character.xml" and having nebula load "character.xml" on startup
   would be something easy - also fixed loading bug with modifications
 * Use of Gconf for storage of configuration
 * User-defined data locations. Suppose I want to create a world
   of my own, and use my own XML files for it. I should be able to tell
   Nebula to use a different data dir, so I needn't to become root and
   modify system files :-)
        - Use the configuration item 'data path', : separate the paths
 * Integrated with XALAN for printing
 * Pretty-print character sheet for characters (XML)
 * Seperation of Nebula, stardust (and other applications) preference items
 * Finish the pretty-print spell lists (XML) <nash>
 * Potential gain works again
 * Skill based stat bonus, if the option is set, uses the stat specified
 	with the skill, instead of the third stat for the category.
 * (Re)Add appearance/sanity/will
 * Clean up printing code in print.c
 * A proper lib nebula - [20021206] libneb.a now exists
