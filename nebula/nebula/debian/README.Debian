nebula for Debian
-----------------

	The data files needed for Nebula are distributed in a separate
	package, nebula-data (also available as Debian package). This is
	because this files are copyrighted by ICE (Iron Crown Enterprises).

	In the directory /usr/share/doc/nebula/characters you can find
	some example characters created with this program.
