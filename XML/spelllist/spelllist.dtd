        Copyright 2002-2003 Brett Nash, Bent Dalager, Thomas Neumann 

        Changes 
        * Version 1.1
            - Fairly major changes from Thomas Neumann; should not break
                compatibility with any existing lists however
            - Added new 'spellbook' element.  
            - Added new 'spellgroup' element.
                A spellbook contains a number of spellgroups.  A spellgroup
                        contains a number of spelllists.  
        * Version 1.0.3
            - Added <ref> to description tags (references to other
                spell lists
            - Allowed multiple spell descriptions.
        * Version 1.0.2
            - Added <annotation> after descriptions
            - Added <rrmod> 
        * Version 1.0.1
            - No changes
