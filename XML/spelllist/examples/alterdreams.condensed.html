<h1>Alter Dreams</h1>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>By Bent Dalager</h3>
<p>
This list focuses on the gradual altering of a dream to twist it into
a dream more to the spell caster's liking. This can be used both to
the benefit and to the detriment of the actual dreamer. If one wants
to use the effects from this list to affect the dreamer's psyche in
some way, they are best combined with psychology skills and some
planning and research.

<p class="spell">
This spell is normally used to track down the dream that the caster
wishes to affect. The spell gives the caster a weak mental link into
the
dream world
through which he can navigate dreams. The link does not yield much in
the way of details, and precise identification of objects within the
dream world is impossible. Only general ideas are transmitted. The
skill "Area Knowledge: Dream World" is used to navigate the dream
world, but a penalty of -20 is applied due to the low quality of the
link. Note that the maintaining of concentration on this spell may
cause additional negative modifiers to be applied to the navigation
skill roll, as well as other activities undertaken within dreams.

The caster may preprogram a repeatedly shifting nature of one single

degree every five minutes. The direction of all future shifts for one
single casting of this spell must be determined at the time of
casting. Note that a "shifting" is considered a spell effect every
time it occurs and so the casting of additional spells on the affected
dream concept will cause the dream to become unstable. A period during
which the caster has elected a shift not to occur, however, is safe
for casting other spells on that concept.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In order to cast most of the spells on this list, the caster must
"touch" the target, which is "1 dream". To "touch a dream", the caster
must either be inside of that dream (by way of some dream travelling
magic, such as the spell "Enter Dreams I"), or he must touch the actual
dreamer that is having the dream in question.
</li>
<li>
A dream's foundation is the concepts upon which it is based. The set
of possible concepts is huge and certainly too large for us to
enumerate here. Examples, however, may include "hungry", "fear",
"beauty", "friendship", "pain", "confusion", "mother", etc. All dreams
are based on at least one concept, most will have 3-4 or more. Each
concept in a dream has a "size" that varies from 1 (almost
insignificant impact) to 10 (totally dominates). A concept may not be
grown beyond 10 nor may it be shrunk beneath 1 (although it can
certainly be removed, which is something else entirely). The actual
dream as seen by the dreamer (and any visitor) is only the
visual/mental manifestation of the concepts that drive the dream.
</li>
<li>
It is important to appreciate the difference between concept "size"
and concept "resilience" when using this list. "Size" is a measure of
the impact the concept has on the dream and is affected by the
"tweak", "mutate" and "warp" spells (and indirectly by the "add" and
"remove" spells). "Resilience" is a measure of how difficult it is to
affect a concept by the use of spells, and is affected by the
"reinforce" and "weaken" spells. It could be said that "size" is a
concept's Strength stat while "resilience" is its Constituation stat.
</li>
<li>
Once a dream concept has been affected by one of the "tweak",
"mutate", "remove", "add" or "warp" spells on its list, it may not be
affected again for a period of five minutes. If an attempt is made to
do so, the dream will become unstable and the dreamer will either
awake or else the dream will be replaced by an entirely new one.
</li>
<li>
Any attempt to tweak, mutate or weaken a dream concept (actually, any
F type spell on this list) needs to overcome the
dream's inherent resistance to being tampered with. The dream resists
with the level of the dreamer, and any applicable bonuses the dreamer
can bring to bear. Note that special spells on this list may give
additional bonuses/maluses.
</li>
<li>
 Note that
while the duration of some of the spells on this list is Permanent,
the effect only lasts as long as the target
concept does, and therefore it never outlasts the dream itself.
