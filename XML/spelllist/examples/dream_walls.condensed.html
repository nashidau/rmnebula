<h1>Dream Walls</h1>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>By Bent Dalager</h3>
<p>
This spell list is primarly used for protecting someone's dreams from
intrusion, and for getting rid of unwanted interference. It can also,
however, be put to good use invading the minds of others and should be
considered a definite maybe for any would-be usurper of dreams.

This spell creates a special type of dream fragment - a dream creature
with a purpose outside of that of the dream itself. This creature will
seek out and attack visitors within the dream. It is considered to
have a skill bonus equal to five times its level when it comes to
detecting visitors. The caster may designate one specific visitor per
level of the creature that will be spared the creature's wrath. The
creature will attempt not to interfere with the dream itself, but will
do so if it proves necessary in order to get rid an unwanted visitor.
The creature will exist until it is destroyed or the dream it was
created in ends. The sentry created with this spell cannot be higher
than first level (a class I entity). It will have physical and combat
stats comparable to a created undead of its own level.

Caster goes into a trance where he can monitor the entry or exit of
visitors in a dream. If any visitor enters or exits the dream, the
caster will know that this has happened. No details are learned, only
the number of visitors and whether they entered or left. The caster
does specifically not learn who it was or where they are/were.

When cast prior to the casting of any other spell (which
must be cast within one minute of casting "Waiting Wall"), the actual
effect of the second spell is delayed. 
Alternatively, this spell can be cast without an
accompanying spell, in which case it will simply alert the caster that
the trigger action occurs. The duration is until the spell is
triggered, or until the dream it is cast in ends.
The spell may trigger on any
one of the following conditions; time, a specific observable
occurrence or
information that could be gleaned through the use of "Detect Visitor"
or "Monitor Dream". Note that if a "Detect Visitor" trigger is
chosen, a specific non-moving 5'R must be chosen and this area will be
constantly monitored. The caster need not cast or pay power points for
the detection spells if such a trigger is chosen - it is built into
this spell.

The dreamer gets to resist this spell. If the spell is successful, the

dream if they want back to the same dreamer.

need to actually cast it (that is handled by this spell). The target
needs to resist the spell chosen for him, not the "Dream Perimeter
True" spell. The caster may either designate one single spell that
will be used on all intruders, or he may elect to choose a different
spell per occurrence. The caster will be aware when a visitor passes
through the barrier, but will not know who it is or where he is
located.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In order to cast most of the spells on this list, the caster must
"touch" the target, which is "1 dream". To "touch a dream", the caster
must either be inside of that dream (by way of some dream travelling
magic, such as the spell "Enter Dreams I"), or he must touch the actual
dreamer that is having the dream in question.
